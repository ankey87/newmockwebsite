                Meet Amanda Key, she is a 32 year old mother of two who decided to leave her career in teaching to

                UX Design
                certificate, and is now working towards completing the UIE portion of the program.</p>
            <p>When Amanda is not working on her certification, she loves working at her job with Southern Legacy
                Marketing &
                Design, and spending
                time with her two beautiful children. She enjoys reading and listening to music, but her passion is

                and development.
